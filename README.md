Bio Network course tasks

# Task description:
•	The task was implemented in python. The used libraries were:
o	Itertools: native python library (list iteration)

•	The relevant files are:
o	Exercise_1.py – The implementation of both questions
o	4 text files representing the output from question 1.
o	Console output example of question 2.

•	The code is built to answer part in a dynamic way according to the user inputs. The user is guided with instruction in the consoles.
o	First the user chooses between question 1 or 2 via inserting the digits 1 or 2. Note, to exit the program the user needs to provide the digit 9.
o	In question 1, the text file that are generated are overwritten if a new run is issued. Moreover, there are 2 modes for question 1:
1.	User input the value n – insert 1 when displayed.
2.	The user chooses to run the code with n=1 to n=4 – insert 2 when displayed.
o	In question 2, please note the format of the input. An example is provided in the console in the run and the output will we printed to it.

•	The design was derived to split the problem into methods to help with the debug process and to re-use the code for both questions
